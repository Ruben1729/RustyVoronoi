# RustyVoronoi
RustyVoronoi is a Voronoi Generator coded in Rust. It uses piston_window to generate the graphics.

The algorithm used is extremely inefficient but the project is meant to be a learning experience anyways.

### Getting Started

Follow these steps to run RustyVoronoi:

Clone the RustyVoronoi repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/your-username/RustyVoronoi.git
```
Navigate to the project directory:

```shell
cd RustyVoronoi
```
Build and run the project using Cargo:

```shell
cargo run
```
The simulation will start, and you can interact with it using the provided keyboard controls.
